  * our goal here is to write pure function

    FP is just programming with functions. Functions are:

      1. Total: They return an output for every input.
      2. Deterministic: They return the same output for the same input.
      3. Pure: Their only effect is computing the output.

    The rest is just composition you can learn over time.
